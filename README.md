# Intrusion-Detection-Prevention-System-in-Python
 This repository contains a Python-based Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) that monitors file system changes, network activity, and system processes in real-time. The tool detects suspicious activities using machine learning-based anomaly detection (Isolation Forest) and provides real-time alerts via a GUI and CLI interface.
